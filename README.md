# CircleDetectionUsingABC

Python algorithm to detect circles in images using the ABC algorithm proposed in chapter 3 of "Evolutionary Computation Techniques: A Comparative Perspective" by Erik Cuevas, Valentin Osuna and Diego Oliva.

To use the algorithm, just call it from your command line with the following syntax:

python main.py \<imagePath\> \<colonySize\> \<abandonmentLimit\> \<maxCycles\> \<alfa\>

Example images processed with this algorithm can be found in the folder "Examples".
